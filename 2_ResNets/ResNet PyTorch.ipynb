    "The dotted line is there precisely because there has been a change in the dimension of the input volume (of course a reduction because of the convolution). Note that this reduction between layers is achieved by an increase on the stride, from 1 to 2, at the first convolution of each layer; instead of by a pooling operation, which we are used to see as down samplers. \n",

This way is easier to understand the mechanism of a particular model, to be able to adjust it to our particular needs – we will see how just changing the dataset forces to change the architecture of the entire model. Also, I will try to follow the notation close to the PyTorch official implementation to make it easier to later implement it on PyTorch.\n",

Taken this into account, it can be seen in Figure 4 that the output size of that operation will be a (112x122) volume. Since each convolution filter (of the 64) is providing one channel in the output volume, we end up with a (112x112x64) output volume – note this is free of the batch dimension to simplify the explanation\n",

    "So, let’s explain this repeating name, block. Every layer of a ResNet is composed of several blocks. This is because when ResNets go deeper, they normally do it by increasing the number of operations within a block, but the number of total layers remains the same – 4. An operation here refers to a convolution a batch normalization and a ReLU activation to an input, except the last operation of a block, that does not have the ReLU.  Therefore, in the PyTorch implementation they distinguish between the blocks that includes 2 operations – Basic Block – and the blocks that include 3 operations – Bottleneck Block.  Note that normally each of these operations is called layer, but we are using layer already for a group of blocks. Let's see the case for a Basic Block then.\n",

    "The next step is to escalate from the entire block to the entire layer. In the Figure 1 we can see how the layers are differentiable by colors. However, if we look at the first operation of each layer, we see that the stride used at that first one is 2, instead of 1 like for the rest of them.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "This means that the <b><i>down sampling of the volume though the network is achieved by increasing the stride instead of a pooling operation</i></b> like normally CNNs do. In fact, only one max pooling operation is performed in our Conv1 layer, and one average pooling layer at the end of the ResNet, right before the fully connected dense layer.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "We can also see another repeating pattern over the layers of the ResNet, the dot layer representing the change of the dimensionality. This agrees with what we just said. The first operation of each layer is reducing the dimension, so we also need to resize the volume that goes through the skip connection, so we could add them like we did before. \n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "This difference on the skip connections are the so called in the paper as <b><i>Identity Shortcut</i></b> and <b><i>Projection Shortcut</i></b>. The identity shortcut is the one we have already discussed, simply bypassing the input volume to the addition operator. The projection shortcut performs a convolution operation to ensure the volumes at this addition operation are the same size. From the paper we can see that there are 2 options for matching the output size. Either <b><i>padding the input volume or perform 1x1 convolutions</i></b>. Here, this second option is shown.\n",

    "Last figure represents this down sampling performed by increasing the stride to 2. The number of filters is duplicated in an attempt to preserve the time complexity for every operation (56*64=28*128). Also, note that now the addition operation cannot be performed since the volume got modified. In the shortcut we need to apply one of our down sampling strategies. The 1x1 convolution approach is shown here: \n",
